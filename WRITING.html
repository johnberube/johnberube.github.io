            <p>Phenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first person
                point of view. The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, the way it is directed
                through its content or meaning toward a certain object in the world. Edmund Husserl, the founder of
                phenomenology, proposed that it serves as a method to explore the fundamental nature and essence of
                phenomena as they are percieved by the human mind, without recourse to theories or assumptions 
                outside of that experience.

            <p>A tautology in logic and mathematics is a statement that is true in every possible interpretation.
                Essentially, it is a formula or assertion that under no circumstance can be false. Tautologies are significant
                in logic because they represent statements that do not depend on specific facts about the world or a particular
                state of affairs; they are true by the virtue of their logical form alone.

            <p>There was a door behind the bar that led somewhere. A red sign above it screamed "EXIT," but from
                afar Javier read "TAXI." Some odd form of humor he thought with a sigh. The last thing anyone needs 
                here is a taxi. Javier looked around. To his left and right lay cowboys with stoned looks on their faces.

            <p>Rain. All day it had rained, and hushed figures hurried past his window. Inside, Elliot's
                finger laced it's way across an apple, finding certain concavities to caress. Weeks fell away in the chair
                he now sat in. Mentally he wandered. To lost places and hopeful destinations. He dreamed. That maybe one day
                he'll save enough to desert this crowded city. Take a trip into the woods and never return. To wander is 
                what Elliot wanted, but Elliot was the type to return home. Elliot began his trips with a check of the return
                ticket. An unintentional mutiny of the trip's entire purpose.

            <p>Writing samples, writing samples, writing samples. All they want is writing samples. Where do the wicked
